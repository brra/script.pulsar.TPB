        This is a provider script for (XBMC/Kodi) Pulsar service! This will provide you the access to thepiratebay.
	This is only a provider to Pulsar ! This addon will be executed by Pulsar (https://github.com/steeve/plugin.video.pulsar/releases), you need Pulsar installed for this provider to work.
	This is important for the script to work! Go in to the Programs -> Pulsar TPB Provider. Press 'C' key or right click Add-on settings Change the url to a proxy that works within our country (this can be googels http://lmgtfy.com/?q=thepiratebay+proxy) change 'Add to movie search' to what ever you want. What this setting will do is to add this prefix to all searches, you can add bluray if you only want to watch bluray movies. You can also add what you dont want to see in your result, such as dubbed by adding - before the prefix.
	Any issues, report to http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=204728
